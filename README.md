# Unofficial Warband Manager

## Why?

I found that while the Mordheim roster sheet is handsome and compact, it is not the easiest to read, and it doesn't enforce any rules. Also having a digital warband roster was even less practical. This is why I decided to make Unofficial Warband Manager. 

Unofficial Warband Manager provides clear UI, saving warbands into cloud, and enforcing Mordheims rules so your warband is more likely to stay legal. It is also intended to work on mobile and desktop. Unofficial Warband Manager is a non-profit open-source project.
